Single Variable Calculus App for Android Phones
App that does the following 
  -takes derivatives/multiple derivatives
  -simplifies the answer or any expression given using basic simplification rules
    -NOTE: this is still somewhat buggy, if it would have been wrong it just returns the original expression unsimplified
  -numerically evaluates an expression 
  -numerically integrates expressions using Simpson's Theorem
